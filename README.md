# Triple Triad with React

FFVIII mini card game made with TypeScript React + Vite + SCSS.

## What to pursue learning:
  * useContext
  * unit testing
  * BEM
    * block
    * block__element
    * block__element--modifier

## What to consider when refactoring:
  * useMemo and useCallback


## Learning rant
 * trying to follow along with a tutorial or someone explaining something, then not understanding the next thing they say, and then losing grasp of everything thereon, like everything starts collapsing at once. What do I even do in this situation besides interrupting and telling them I don't get it? What if I can't get it at that time? How do I efficiently move on? I think I just have to accept that I can't always understand 100% of it in one session. Or ever. I can get better at understanding more.
